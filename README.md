# fieldspeccode
My public repository for ASD FieldSpec 4 data handling

We'll start with a few lines of code to ease the knitting of lots of individual FieldSpec measurements to one large spreadsheet. This will allow us to easily assign the measurements to measured objects (e.g. individual plants) and add columns with additional information relevant for further analysis (e.g. treatment; location; day of measurement; ...).
We could also add all kinds of spectral indices to this spreadsheet.
