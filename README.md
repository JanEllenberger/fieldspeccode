My public repository for ASD FieldSpec 4 data handling

First thing to look at is the PowerPoint on FieldSpec data extraction.

The next step is putting all your FieldSpec data together with the knit_to_spreadsheet.R and annotating it in Excel or a similar program:

These lines of code ease the knitting of lots of individual FieldSpec measurements to one large spreadsheet. This will allow you to easily assign the measurements to measured objects (e.g. individual plants) and add columns with additional information relevant for further analysis (e.g. treatment; location; day of measurement; ...). You will also be able to add all kinds of spectral indices to this spreadsheet.

The third part will cover visualization and analysis of your FieldSpec data.
